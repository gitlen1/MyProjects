# project: Develop a database solution

Our customer have commissioned us to develop a solution for their need to save data from their applications. The applications they use are mostly written in python, so we've decided to write a python library for them to address the issue of writing and reading application data to disk.

The project have the following requirements:

- it should allow python code to save python objects (of type dict) to a single file to disk.

- it should allow python code to fetch objects saved to file

- each object saved to the DB should be accessible via a key (of type str)

- it should be easily installable via PIP (but the code should not be committed to pypi)

- it should be well-documented (docstrings and a README.md showing how to use the library)

- there should be unit tests in place, and the code should have high enough coverage

The whole project will be divided into 2 1-week sprints.

As a team discuss the backlog and plan what to tackle on sprint 1, and what to postpone to sprint 2.

Make sure each user story is well-defined and that a definition of done and a definition of ready is included or can be implied.

Decide who will be scrum master for this sprint.

Plan when and how to hold daily scrum meetings.

Divide all user stories for sprint 1 amongst the team members (remember: the scrum master does not work on user stories during the week).

During sprint planning you will not have access to the customer nor the product owner.

When all groups are ready, you will have the possibility to ask the customer or the product owner for clarification and feedback.

1.1.2. Daily scrum with product owner
Once all the groups are done with sprint planning, we will take the first daily scrum meeting. The product owner will attend the meeting.
